TALK IS CHEAP SHOW ME THE CODE :- 
    Now in this session we are going to design our food ordering app first 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    What components our app can have ?
        Header 
            -Logo 
            -Nav Item (Menu)

        Body 
            -Search
            -Restro Container
                -Restro Cards (Restro Cards)
        Footer 
            -Copyrights 
            -Links 
            -Address 
            -Contact Info
    So this is the best way to plan an APP

    what is a functional component -> its nothing but a JS function 
    What is an app component ? -> its a function that returns JSX code
